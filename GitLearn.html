<h1>Git & GitHub</h1>
<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Git is a version control system that helps us to manage the project versions, organize the application in the remote repository (of which one of them is <b>GitHub</b>) also allows developers to collaborate on the projects.</p>
<h2>GitHub</h2>    
<p>GitHub is a hosting service for storing the data on remote repository.Before diving deeper into Git and Github commands, lets focus on the fundamentals of Git and GitHub pointed below.<p></p><br>
 <ol><li>Working Directory</li>
    <li>Staging Area</li>
    <li>Local repository</li>
    <li>Remote repository</li></ol></p>

1. <b>Working Directory:</b> The Directoy in which the project exists and you are currently working in.<br>
2. <b>Staging Area:</b> A file in the directory that stores the information on what goes in next commit.<br>
3. <b>Local Repository:</b> The folder or store in our local machine where the application and its related are stored.<br>
4. <b>Remote Repository:</b> The hosting service over the internet (<b>GitHub</b>) where the changes are pushed into after the commit.

<p>From Fig.1, we can the git add command is used to add the modified files to the staging area which upon commit will make the
    changes into the Local repository using git commit and then push them into remote repository using git push command. git pull will pull the
    data into local repository where as git fetch just retrives the changes without making changes to the local respository. Once the changes
    pushed into remote repository are confirmed, pull request is raised for review and further review and confirmation of changes the request
    is merged.
</p>

<p><b>Branch:</b> Branch is just a copy of the master environment. For example say we have 10 developers working on 10 different features
of a same project and in order to not have high load on the master data different branches are created and assigned one per developer.</p>

<p><b>Merging Conflicts:</b> Suppose say two developers are working on a project and developer1 completed the task and pushed the changes,
 raised and merged the request, upon completion developer2 also completed the task and pushed it to the remote repository, now he wants
to merge the request, upon merging it will raise merge conflict since the master file has been modified after he pulled it, so developer2
 have to move to the master branch, pull the repository and then go back to his dev2 branch and then merge the origin/master and make 
the changes whether by accepting both changes or either one or none, and then again add it to the satging area and then commit and push.</p>
