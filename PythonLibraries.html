    <h1>Python Libraries For Data Science</h1>
    <h2>NumPy - Numeric Python</h2>
    <p> NumPy also known as Numeric Python is an open source python library extensively used in science and engineering. NumPy library contains multi-dimensional arrays that are homogeneous, 
        N-dimensional ndarray and various functions that are used for effective transformation of these data structures. <br><br>

        Python lists are excellent data storage containers. They are heterogeneous which means they store variety of data and they are quite fast in performing individual operations on
        handful of elements, whereas NumPy shines when it comes to large amount of homogeneous data being more efficient, reducing memory consumption.

    <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
    <p>Array is a python structure for storing and retrieving data. In python these commonly referred as ndarray, for example the one row of data can be thought as a 1-Dimensional
      array, a table with rows and column can be a 2-Dimensional array and stack of N tables can be thought as N-dimesnional arrays.<br><br>

      The requirments of a NumPy array - <br><br>
      1. The data to be stored should be of same data type.<br>
      2. The size of the numpy array cannot be changed once the array is created.<br>
      3. The shape should be rectangular, which means every row in the array should have the same number of columns.
